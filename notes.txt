First Steps
        -decide what methods to use (add below once figured out)
                -multi-class SVM
        -find libraries for each method
        -figure out exact criteria for comparison between algorithms
        -figure out how to compare speeds
        -write program to compare methods
                -figure out output of different libraries
                -standardize input from outputs
                -make statistical analysis
                -create mathematica notebook with visualizations
